**by Michel Clasquin-Johnson**

Trope is a text editor with spell checking and easy access to high-ASCII and some Unicode characters. It also serves as the basis for other, more specialised text editors.

Trope2 is the development name for a major rewrite. Once installed, it will run as Trope v0.9

Written in yab using the Yabadabbadoo IDE, but you can load the file Rondel.yab in the "binder" directory into the Official yab IDE.

Written under Haiku x86_64 Beta 1, emulated under QEMU on a Linux Host. I am no longer testing my applications on 32-bit Haiku, but you are of course welcome to try..
