Trope is a text editor. Nothing special about it, you've used text editors =
before. But it has a few features you won't find in other text editors.<br>
<br>
Previously this was Public Domain software, but since version 0.9 it has be=
en licensed under the MIT license. If your copy of this program did not con=
tain the MIT License, you can see it at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT=
.<br>
<br>
Keyboard shortcuts like ALT-N below assume that you are using the haiku sta=
ndard keyboard layout. If you have changed this to the Windows/Linux mode t=
hey should be read as CTRL-N and so forth.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DFILE Menu=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
Operations that affect files.<br>
<br>
NEW (or Alt-N)<br>
Open a new, empty window.<br>
<br>
Note that the Settings in this window will reflect the last settings change=
s you made in ANY window. You open window A and from there new window B, Yo=
u change settings in window B, You now change back to window A. and decide =
to open window C. Window C  will open with the setting changes you made in =
Window B.<br>
<br>
OPEN (or Alt-O)<br>
Open a file. A dialog box appears in which you can choose which file to ope=
n. Please note that you can also drop a text file on any new, blank window =
from the Desktop or any Tracker window.You should not, however, drop more t=
han one file simultaneously. Only one of them will load. If you have a alre=
ady file open and want to one another, please open a new, empty instance of=
 the program first<br>
<br>
Note: Trope will quite happily open more than one instance of the same file=
, and you might end up saving different versions over one another.<br>
<br>
INSERT<br>
Insert a file into the current file.<br>
<br>
SAVE (or Alt-S)<br>
Save the file. If it has not been saved before, you will get a chance to ch=
oose a destination directory and a name for the file. Names with spaces in =
them should be OK.<br>
<br>
SAVE AS<br>
Save the file under a new name and/or destination.<br>
<br>
REVERT<br>
Lose all changes and go back to the last saved version of your file.Only be=
comes available once the file has been saved at least once.<br>
<br>
Note: Don't ever try to name a file --ReVeRtFiLe-- because that is a code t=
he app uses internally for this function. Things could get unpredictable in=
 a hurry.<br>
<br>
TRANSFER<br>
Although Trope is the greatest text editor ever ;-) there are others. This =
Function allows you to transfer the file to Pe or StyledEdit and closes the=
 current window. I have other Text Editors and Text-handling utilities in t=
he works. Once these are available and if you have them installed, they wil=
l automagically appear in this menu.<br>
<br>
QUIT (or press ALT-Q).<br>
Quit the program<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DRECENT... Menu=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
CLEAR RECENT FILES<br>
Empty the list of recently used files.<br>
<br>
The rest of this menu is populated with the ten most recently opened files.=
 First open a blank window, then click on one of them to open it.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DEDIT Menu=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
UNDO/REDO (or ALT-Z)<br>
Undoes the last editing action. If nothing else has happened since, you can=
 then Redo, that is, undo the undo. Sorry, one level of undo only, no buffe=
r.<br>
<br>
CUT, COPY &amp; PASTE<br>
These commands carry out the usual clipboard actions. Paste only becomes av=
ailable once something has been copied, either in this program or in anothe=
r.<br>
<br>
COPY TO SNIPPET<br>
Copy the currently selected text to the Snippets dropdown (see below). Only=
 becomes available once there is something to copy, either a selection in t=
he editing area or, failing that, in the cut/paste buffer. Either way, snip=
pets can only be 80 characters long. If you need more than that, try someth=
ing like Clipdinger.<br>
<br>
CLEAR SELECTION<br>
Deleted the currently selected text.<br>
<br>
CLEAR ALL<br>
Clear the entire window. If you use this command by mistake, just use the U=
ndo function (see above).<br>
<br>
FIND<br>
Find the next occurrence of the text in the Find input box in the lower rig=
ht corner of the window. You can also just type your text in there and pres=
s ALT-F. Pressing ENTER interfered with the Replace function and was disabl=
ed<br>
<br>
FIND AGAIN<br>
Find the next occurrence of the previous Find operation<br>
<br>
REPLACE<br>
A fairly primitive GLOBAL, case-dependent search-and-replace using the text=
 in the Find and Replace input boxes at the bottom of the window. You can a=
lso just type your text in there and press ALT-R<br>
<br>
Note: I have no plans to implement a proper Replace function in Trope.  Fra=
nkly, I don't see the point of competing with the superb Replace function i=
n Pe. But it's open-source code: feel free to give it a go<br>
<br>
SELECT ALL<br>
Select all text.<br>
<br>
SPELLING<br>
Gives access to the spell checker and other writer's tools. This occurs in =
a separate window and editing is disabled until you exit that window. To sp=
ell-check, you first need to select a language from the Settings Menu. Whil=
e spell-checking happens, in a separate window, your document will be greye=
d out  and not editable. UK English is installed by default. Language packs=
 are separately installed either from the Help menu or via Haikudepot.<br>
<br>
You can only spellcheck the entire file, not a selection of text. Please no=
te that the current version of aspell on Haiku sometimes gets stuck on dete=
cting High-ASCII and Unicode characters, in which case you will have to jus=
t choose (i)gnore and move on. Sorry about that<br>
<br>
SORT<br>
Sorts a selected block of lines in four specifiable ways: alphabetical, rev=
erse alphabetical, numerical and reverse numerical. You cannot sort the ent=
ire file directly, but you can always select the entire file, and then sort=
.<br>
<br>
SPACING<br>
These options let you double- or triplespace a document, remove all blank l=
ines, or insert three spaces at the beginning of every line/paragraph. This=
 affects the entire document.<br>
<br>
CASE<br>
Change the case of selected text in four different patterns.<br>
<br>
WHITE SPACE<br>
A variety of options to manipulate the appearance of your text. This affect=
s the entire document.<br>
<br>
NUMBERING<br>
Number the lines in your text. This can not be reversed.<br>
<br>
CONVERT<br>
Switch between Linux/Haiku/Mac OSX and DOS/Windows line endings. You should=
 not ordinarily need this. But it's there.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DASCII Menu=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
This menu allows you to insert high-ASCII accented and other characters. No=
te that you can always use Haiku's Character Map.The character is also copi=
ed to the system clipboard, so you can use it again.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DUNICODE Menu=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
This menu allows you to insert Unicode accented characters. Latin character=
s only, sorry, and even then only those I can figure out. If you want an ed=
itor for Cyrillic, Cherokee or CJK character sets, grab the Trope source an=
d roll your own. You have my blessings. Note that you can always use Haiku'=
s Character Map.The character is also copied to the system clipboard, so yo=
u can use it again.<br>
<br>
It is quite possible that I have messed up the organisation of these charac=
ters. Perhaps in your language, an "i" with a macron above and a dot below =
it is not an  "i" at all but is pronounced  "Aaaaaaaargh"! If so, contact m=
e (clasqm at gmail dot com) and we'll see what we can do. The same is true =
if I missed a character somewhere.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DSETTINGS Menu=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
WORD WRAP<br>
<br>
WORD WRAP | ON<br>
WORD WRAP | OFF<br>
Word wrap is ON by default when you first start the program, but you can ch=
ange that. Please note that this is a global setting. You can have two wind=
ows open, one with word wrap on and another with it off. But the next Trope=
 window you open, whether it is seconds or months later, will have the sett=
ing of the last window you closed. The setting does not get saved with a sp=
ecific document.<br>
<br>
WORD WRAP | RE-WRAP<br>
You only need this if you have word wrap set to ON and you have resized the=
 window. It will redo the word wrapping to fit the new window size.<br>
<br>
BACKUP | ON<br>
BACKUP | OFF<br>
If set to ON, every time you save your file this creates a duplicate file w=
ith the extension .bkp in the same directory where your original file resid=
es. Like word wrap, this is a global setting and will be remembered the nex=
t time you open the program.<br>
<br>
TOOLBAR | GRAPHICS ON<br>
TOOLBAR | GRAPHICS OFF<br>
Lets you choose whether to use a graphical overlay over the toolbar. This i=
s a global setting and is saved when you c;lose the last window.<br>
<br>
AUTOSUGGEST | ASSIST ON<br>
AUTOSUGGEST | ASSIST OFF<br>
Autosuggest is automatically switched on when starting the program or when =
you select a new language and if your chosen language has an Autosuggest wo=
rd list (not all of them do). This option allows you to switch it off and o=
n manually. This setting does not get saved when closing the last window<br=
>
<br>
To use Autosuggest use the CURSOR RIGHT arrow when a correct suggestion is =
made.<br>
<br>
AUTOSUGGEST | EDIT USER'S WORD LIST<br>
The Autosuggest word lists were compiled from lists of the thousand most co=
mmon words in each language, with one- or two-letter words removed. But you=
 have a much larger vocabulary, of course. This function lets you edit the =
auxiliary word lists and add your own, unique words. Please note that these=
 lists are separate for each language and in some cases for variants of a l=
anguage. Therefore, a word list for UK English will not replicate to one fo=
r US English. unless you engage in some symlink-fu in the Settings director=
y.<br>
<br>
INSTALL<br>
Lets you install various aspell dictionaries. A restart is required to make=
 the new language active and selectable. You can also install these languag=
e packs from HaikuDepot or the command line. As new dictionaries become ava=
ilable in Haiku, they will be added to this program.<br>
<br>
LANGUAGE<br>
Select a language for this document. Once you have selected a language (dep=
ending on which ones you have installed), Autosuggest is switched ON if tha=
t pack has a functional Autosuggest dictionary - not all do - but you can a=
lso switch it OFF from the Autosuggest menu (see above). This menu is also =
used to select a language for spell-Checking. The same language will be aut=
omatically used in the next document.<br>

urrent document.<br>
<br>
LOREM IPSUM<br>
insert a specified number of filler text into your document. A variety of o=
ptions are offered over and above the usual Latin one. This uses the LOREM =
utility by Per Erik Strandberg (distributed under the GNU GPL3). If you do =
not have it already, a copy will be generated in /boot/home/config/non-pack=
aged/bin.<br>

<h2>
=3D=3D=3DTOOLBAR=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
The toolbar below the menu gives quick access to some of the most commonly-=
used functions. Toolbar items will always be the same across all Trope-base=
d applications<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DStatus Button=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
The status button in the bottom left corner gives you an APPROXIMATE word a=
nd page count, based on the assumption anything separated by one or more sp=
aces or tabs or a new line is a word and that a page is 300 words. It does =
not update live, only every time you choose a menu command. You can also pr=
ess the button to update it manually.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DSearch Field=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
The Search field in the bottom right corner lets you enter text to do a cas=
e-insensitive search of your document. Type the text you want to search for=
, then press ALT-F.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DSnippets Dropdown=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
The Snippets dropdown in the bottom far right corner allows you to store up=
 to 15 short pieces of text and paste them elsewhere in your document. Crea=
te snippets by selecting text and selecting Copy to Snippet from the Edit m=
enu. To paste a snippet into your text, select the one you want, then press=
 the button marked P=E2=9C=94 to the right of the dropdown selector.<br>
<br>
Snippets are NOT saved between sessions or between documents.<br>
<br>
<h2>
=3D=3D=3DFUTURE ENHANCEMENTS=3D=3D=3D<br>
</h2>
<br>
Trope is a testbed, a code base from which to move on to more interesting p=
rojects. It will probably not receive further enhancements, but may get som=
e refinements and code optimisations in the future as new versions of Haiku=
 and yab become available.<br>
